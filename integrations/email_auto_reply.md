# Email Auto-Reply Integration

You can connect this AI agent to handle basic email responses.

1. Set up a forwarding rule from `support@business.com` to your automation tool.
2. Parse the email subject and body.
3. Use the AI agent to generate a reply if it's a simple FAQ.
4. If complex, create a task/ticket instead and forward to a human.
