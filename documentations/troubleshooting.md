# Troubleshooting

Common issues:

1. The bot is giving wrong answers.
   → Check FAQ content. The AI can only work with what you provide.

2. The bot does not escalate properly.
   → Review `escalation_rules.txt` and ensure your workflows route correctly.

3. The bot is too wordy.
   → Adjust `tone_prompt.txt` to enforce shorter responses.

4. The bot is not appearing live.
   → Confirm platform connection is active (IG, FB, WhatsApp, webchat, etc.).
