# Customization Guide

You should customize:

- Business name & branding
- FAQ content
- Escalation rules & emails
- Supported languages
- Tone (more formal / more casual)
- Operating hours (if you want it to say "We're closed" after hours)

For each new client, duplicate this repo or copy files into a client-specific version, then update:

- {{Business Name}}
- Contact emails
- Phone numbers
- Support policies
